   Welcome! I'm currently on my journey as a Computer Science student, software programmer, and a Teacher's Assistant at a small Liberal Arts College in Kentucky.

  I have a strong foundation in Python, C++, and starting to learn C#, and I have familiarity with some data analysis tools and SQL. I am specifically interested in the crossroads of computer science and sociology, where I aim to use my skills to help explain aspects of society and business through data analysis. I'm on the lookout for opportunities that will allow me to merge these disciplines, whether in research, tech development, or data analysis roles, to make a tangible difference.
