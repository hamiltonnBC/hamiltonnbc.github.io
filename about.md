  <p>Computer Science Enthusiast and Creator at Heart. <p>
    <p> As a non-traditional student, I transferred to Berea College in Kentucky after graduating summa cum laude from Eastern Gateway Community College. I serve as the SGA Liaison for the Non-Traditional Student Association and the Vice Chairperson of the Campus Improvement Committee, and I participate in various other school organizations. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, rock climbing, hiking, and cycling. This summer, in 2024, I will be interning with Virginia Tech in their Data Science for the Public Good Program. <p>
